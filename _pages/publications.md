### Data Distribution Aware Clustering for Parallel Split Learning in Healthcare Applications (Under Review)
Md. Tanvir Arafat  
**Keywords:** Split Learning, Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning  

This work introduces a Data Distribution Aware Clustering-based Parallel Split Learning (DCSL) framework for healthcare applications. It optimizes model convergence for non-IID data across client devices, outperforming traditional split learning in training latency and accuracy. Contributions include a novel clustering approach using the Kullback-Leibler Divergence metric and a Deep Reinforcement Learning method to solve the clustering problem.
